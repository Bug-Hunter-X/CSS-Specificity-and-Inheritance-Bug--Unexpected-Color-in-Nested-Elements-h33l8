The solution lies in understanding and correctly managing CSS specificity.  The `div p` selector has higher specificity than the `p` selector, therefore overriding the `color:red`. However, it does not inherit the `color:blue` from the parent `div`,  thus producing green text as expected.

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green; /* This overrides both previous declarations */
}
```

To ensure predictable behavior, be explicit in your CSS and avoid relying on unexpected inheritance when dealing with high specificity selectors.
